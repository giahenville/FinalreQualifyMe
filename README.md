# reQualify Me


**reQualify Me** is a website designed to help individuals, particularly women, redefine what it means to be qualified for a job.


reQualify Me takes in a user's **resume** and **soft skills** to generate a general overview of their strengths. When a user finds a job they're interested in, they can input the **job description** to receive a report on whether they are qualified for the role.


According to Harvard Business Review, women tend to apply for jobs only when they meet **100% of the qualifications**, while men apply when they meet just **50%**. ReQualify Me encourages users to apply if they meet **60%** of the required skills, helping to overcome this confidence gap.


1. **Input Resume & Soft Skills**  
   Users upload or enter their resume and a list of soft skills.


2. **Enter Job Description**  
   Users paste the description of a job they’re interested in.


3. **Skill Matching**  
   An AI model (not yet implemented) compares the user’s skills against the job requirements.


4. **Qualification Feedback**  
   - If the user meets **50% or more** of the required skills, they are encouraged to apply.
   - If not, the tool highlights missing skills and suggests areas to improve.




While not implemented yet, an AI model will be trained to:
- Parse and extract skills from resumes and job descriptions.
- Compare and match relevant skills.
- Provide personalized feedback and guidance.


To empower users, especially women, to apply confidently for roles even if they don’t meet every listed requirement, promoting a more inclusive and realistic understanding of job qualifications.
